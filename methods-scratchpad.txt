I asked Claude.ai to ask me questions.

Sampling Questions:
1. When did you conduct your field sampling? (specific months/years, and was it all done in one field season or multiple?)
2. How did you select which individuals to sample within each population? (random sampling, systematic transects, targeting specific areas, etc.)
3. What was your sampling strategy for spacing? (did you maintain minimum distances between sampled individuals, and if so, how far apart?)
4. What type of tissue did you collect? (leaves, stems, roots?) And how much tissue per individual?
5. How did you preserve and store the samples? (silica gel, liquid nitrogen, freezer storage, etc.)
6. Did you take any GPS coordinates or create maps of your sampling locations?
7. What permits or permissions did you need to collect from these endangered plant populations?

Library Prep & Sequencing Questions:
8. What RADSeq protocol are you using specifically? (ddRAD, ezRAD, original RAD, etc.) And which restriction enzyme(s)?
9. Are you doing the library preparation yourself or sending samples to a sequencing facility? If facility - which one?
10. What sequencing platform and read configuration? (Illumina NovaSeq, HiSeq, etc. and single-end vs paired-end, read length)
11. How many samples are you multiplexing per lane/run?
12. Did you include any controls (blanks, replicates, etc.)?

Filtering and assembly:
13. What software/pipeline are you planning to use for processing the raw reads? (Stacks, ipyrad, dDocent, etc.)
14. What are your quality filtering parameters going to be? (minimum read depth, missing data thresholds, etc.)
15. Are you planning to use a reference genome or do de novo assembly? (I believe there might not be a reference for Polemonium?)

Analysis questions:
16. For clone detection - what genetic similarity threshold will you use to consider individuals as clones?
17. What population genetics statistics are you planning to calculate? (FST, heterozygosity, allelic richness, etc.)
